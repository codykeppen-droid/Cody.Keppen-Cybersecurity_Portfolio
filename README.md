# **Cody Keppen's Cybersecurity Portfolio**

Welcome to my portfolio. This repository contains write-ups, lab work, and projects demonstrating my skills in cybersecurity. I just started using Github in November and any advice would be appreciated as I learn to use this as a portfolio.

As an entry-level SOC Analyst with 9 years of experience in quality assurance and data integrity, I focus on applying rigorous, data-driven analysis to security challenges.

## **Projects & Write-Ups**

Here you will find detailed reports from my labs and personal projects.
